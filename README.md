# Jukebox-with-Audio-visualization
This is a simple jukebox which displays beautiful circular visualizations on screen when the music plays. It uses Express.js for the server side scripting.



**Installation**
Clone the repository
    ``cd Jukebox
    
    npm install
    cd main 
    node main.js
    
 The server will run on localhost:3000
 
 **Add your playlist to the folder audio folder inside main folder**
 
Open the localhost:3000 and hover on the side sliding navbar. You will find your list of songs added to the folder.(I have used express.js for side scripting to get the access of folder. 
Click on the song name and message will be displayed informing that song and visualisation is loaded. Now click on the play button on  top-right corner. Your song will play with visualisation.

There are two audio visualisations currently(working to add more!)

**Circular-audio wave**


**Sunburst**
